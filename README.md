# Senior-Project
My Senior Project which was a website that used Python scripts to scrape the prices of Magic the Gathering Cards from several trading card selling sites. Used a PHP and JQuery powered website that took the current and all past scraped prices to create a JQPlot powered set of graphs that show the market for cards. Uses JQPlot, Jquery local scroll, and bootstrap.


Due to limitations of the school server you will notice in the python folder there is a standard pricescraper.py and then several more price scrapers these additional scrapers were the ones that were used, this is because the server would kick the account off after a set amount of time, so I had to log on through out the day to keep the prices updating.
